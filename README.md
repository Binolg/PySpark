# Big Data Project Showcase

## Description

This repository serves as a showcase for a school project developed using PySpark for Big Data processing. It aims to demonstrate the practical application of PySpark and related technologies in handling large datasets.

This project allowed me to learn, apply and highlight tools used for Big Data handling, and was also my first time using Docker as a tool for development.
